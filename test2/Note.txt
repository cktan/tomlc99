Note that we utilize the 'jq' command to normalize json files for comparison. Depending the
verson of jq on your system, some tests may generate error that looks like this:

   parse error: Exceeds depth limit for parsing at line 1

This is an error in 'jq', and it does not indicate that the tests themselves fail.
